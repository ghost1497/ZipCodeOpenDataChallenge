*Open Data Delaware has been focused on answering one question: 
How can we make Delaware the most accessible state in the country?*

People with disabilities desire mobile independence above all else, which raises the need for better access design. 
Our solution provides a fun and innovative way to overcome those accessibility challenges at the tip of fingers. 


## Problems to alleviate:
Lack of elevators in large establishments 
Faded zebra crossings on crossways (for those w/ vision impairments)
Move theaters with no subtitle accommodation (for those w/ hearing impairments) 
Lack of informational signs with Braille (vision impaired)
Steps and curbs that block entrances
Stripes on train zone

## Solutions:
Delaware version of WheelMaps - Crowdsource based platform with safe navigation with viable accessibility
pin-pointed map + BlindSquare - Navigation for the vision impaired that implements audio in multiple languages +
