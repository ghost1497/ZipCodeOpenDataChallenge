## Problem
*Open Data Delaware has been focused on answering one question:* 
How can we make Delaware the most accessible state in the country?

## Solution
People with disabilities desire mobile independence above all else, which raises the need for better access design. 
Our solution provides a fun and innovative way to overcome those accessibility challenges at the tip of fingers.
 

# Technical Rubric:
-
*Openness*
- Is the source code publicly available?
- Are the transformation steps of the data available for others to download and check?

*Data*
- Are there relevant DelDOT &  DNREC API data utilized and accounted for?

*Viability*
- Is the solution viable?
- Is their a minimum viable product that demonstrates proof of concept functionality?

*Technology*
- Is the prototype reusable/extensible? (scalability)
- Is the code clean?
- Are the external dependencies free or at least have a reasonable cost?

# Creative Rubric:
-
*Uniqueness*
- Is the concept original?

*Problem Solved*
- Is there a solution to core problem?
- Is there a clear description of what the app does?
- Does the app actually reach the target audience?
- How are the services used?
- Are relevant questions answered?

*Feasibility*
- Does the proposal address how the idea can be reasonably implemented and supported?

*Impact*
- Does the idea improve accessibility to outdoor spaces and transit modes for the underserved.

#Questions:
1.) Design Response:
What devices are this app compatible with?

2.) Iterative Design:
In app user behavior analytics? (Help Dev team understand how people use the app)

3.) K.I.S.S. Model (Keep it simple stupid)
Can multiple tasks be done with fewer steps?
*Optimize images and load times*

4.) User Test:
Has the app been tested by other users?

5.) App Visualization:
Does the app have a heavy text design?

6.) Security:
How secure is the app?
Can the data from the back end be easily accessed?
What is controlling access?

7.) Use cases for targeted market:
What is important to the user?
What is the focus of this app that alleviates a users issue?
Who is the demographic?
What makes the app interactive?

8.) Guidelines:
Does the app focus on core features over minor ones?

9.) Data:
Is the information used accurate?
Is the information appropriate/relevant for the targeted audience?
Does the app include any instructions congealed to mesh with the visual-first design?

10.) Issues:
If there are any bugs with the app how can I contact someone to let them know?

# Where is the data stored?
-
- Create a way to log all actions and data coming into the app
- This should consist of logging errors, long load times, store user profile, buttons frequently hit
- Way to collect user data and respond very fast to optimize UI/UX
- Encrypt the sensitive data in the back-end for security
