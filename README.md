## Challenge Statement 
- Tons of people visit and live in big cities like Philadelphia and New York. These cities have amazing looking applications and websites to assist those who are visiting those locations. There aren't many user friendly solutions that help visitors, or even residents, to explore Delaware and its rich history, nightlife, and fun scenes.

## Planned Approach
####  Delaware Explore App:
- Prototype based in Wilmington
	- Restaurants
	- Parking
	- Transportation
	- Recreation
	- Hotels & AirBnbs
- This is a travel itinerary that assists visitors and residents in exploring things to do around Delaware. We plan to start by focusing on Wilmington, DE and expand to more major cities as the project expands. The app works by picking out your plans for the day via a drag and drop menu and the app calculates travel plans for you.
